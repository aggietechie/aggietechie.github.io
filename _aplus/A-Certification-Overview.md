**One of the best beginner certifications an IT can get.**

To me, the A+ is easily one of the best ways to dip your feet into the basics of Information Technology.

Administered by [CompTIA](https://www.comptia.org/), a well known IT certification organization, the A+ describes itself as: "the industry standard for establishing a career in IT".

## What is it?

The CompTIA A+ Certification is a 2-part introductory cert which tests surface level knowledge over a wide variety of technology areas. As detailed in their website, they list 9 key skills (domains):

It is a great way to learn about industry best practices and standards that will set you up for success. Any level of techie, with studying, can take and pass this certification.

## Certification Breakdown

[Here's the exam information directly from CompTIA.](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a)

First and foremost: *the cost*. This certification, like many others, costs money. *(I'll discuss my opinion on spending money on certifications in a later article)*. Each exam is **$232 USD**, making the total of the certification essentially **$464 USD** (plus taxes). Not the most expensive, but certainly not the cheapest exam.

Essentially, the certification is achieved by passing two exams: Core 1 and Core 2. Each exam discusses independent topics, *so you can start with either exam first*. I did it in logical order (1, then 2), but it really doesn't matter.

The exams are (as of the publishing of this article) administered online, and consist of multiple choice and *performance based questions* (which I'll explain later).

### Core 1 (220 - 1001)

The first exam focuses on the following **five** domains:
* 1.0 Mobile Devices (14%)
* 2.0 Networking (20%)
* 3.0 Hardware (27%)
* 4.0 Virtualization and Cloud Computing (12%)
* 5.0 Hardware and Network Troubleshooting (27%)

You can find the full breakdown of each domain topic [here](https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/comptia-a-220-1001-exam-objectives.pdf), and I'll be making articles for each one in the future.

The % represents how much of the exam will focus on each domain - not necessarily the amount of content on each domain.

### Core 2 (220 - 1002)

The second exam focuses on the following four domains:
* 1.0 Operating Systems (27%)
* 2.0 Security (24%)
* 3.0 Software Troubleshooting (26%)
* 4.0 Operational Procedures (23%)

Again, you can find the full breakdown of each domain topic [here](https://www.nybi.org/documents/220-1002-exam-objectives.pdf), and I'll be making articles for each one in the future.

## Objectives: What to Learn?

Those two links above? Those documents are your life saver. So much so I'll add it again down below:
* [CompTIA 220-1001 Exam Objectives](https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/comptia-a-220-1001-exam-objectives.pdf)
* [CompTIA 220-1002 Exam Objectives](https://www.nybi.org/documents/220-1002-exam-objectives.pdf)

Each domain covers a set of objectives, each with it's own subset of specific topics to learn.

So, in theory, you could simply Google each term above and learn that way. For many, the challenge is being able to tie all the concepts together to actually meet the *objective*. That's where guides like Professor Messer, Mike Meyers, and other step-by-step guides (hopefully such as this one) really help.

## Memorization vs. Application

You have the exam objectives and topics. Is memorizing each term enough to pass the test?

My personal opinion is **no**.

The exam will not be straightforward. Is it not a
> "What is RAM?"

type exam, but rather,
> "Mary wants to run high performance video games on her computer. Which size and type of RAM will be best suited for her?"

The questions test both your knowledge and application of the concepts learned to real life situations. They will feel very similar to a help desk type situation, where you are diagnosing and suggesting solutions based on the concepts of the exam.

For these reasons, you can try to do a straight-through memorization of each concept, but make sure you understand and know how to apply them!

## Version History: Does it Matter?

The version of the exam is noted by the last number of the exam (in this case, 1001 and 1002). The retirement of this exam is listed on the website, meaning when a new exam is released, the old one is

In my opinion, version history is a matter of *relevance* and *ease of studying*, not necessarily of the difficulty of the exam or it's application. For example, the prior exam 220-901, released in 2015 and retired around 2019 with the introduction of 220-1001, does *not* have the Virtualization and Cloud Computing domain.

You could argue that Cloud Computing is a major force of today's world in information technology - so the relevance of 901 is just a bit outdated. Not to say that 901

You may be wondering, *901 isn't available, so why are you still talking about it?*

Eventually, 1001 will be outdated, and there will be about a 6-12 month period of overlap between 1001 and the next exam (which I'll assume will be named 1101). If you're one year out from the exam retirement, it may be worth waiting the year for the new exam to come out, since it will be more relevant.

In their website, CompTIA states the expected retirement date of the current exam and release of the new exam.

The trade off is **ease of studying material**. Older exams have more content to study - practice exams, video tutorials, articles (like this one). A newer exam will have less material. This may not be a problem, especially if you are willing to go through each exam objective and learn through Googling and independent research. But there won't be much of a tailored guide to the exam when it is starting out.

Ultimately, version history is a matter of preference (unless otherwise stated by an employer or external requirement), and no matter which exam you take, you'll learn valuable information from both.

## Recommended Experience: Are You Ready?

At this point, you may see in the exam details or objectives it says:
> Recommended experience: 9 to 12 months hands-on experience in the lab or field.

I'm here to tell you that if you are planning to study for this exam, you do **NOT** need prior experience. It certainly helps, but you certainly do not need it if you take the time to study each exam concept and objective thoroughly.
