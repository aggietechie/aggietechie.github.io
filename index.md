Technology is becoming an integral part of our lives. There's thousands of guides which can help you become an expert programmer and develop tech skills. This site is for tech enthusiast, those interested in career in information technology, and those generally interested in learning a bit more about how topics such as digital security, building (and understanding) a PC, and other skills I've found may be useful for anyone to know.

Topics that I enjoy talking about are:
* CompTIA Certifications (A+, Network+, Security+)
* Programming Experiences (Hackathons, CTF)
* Random Technology Applications (Building a Computer, Messing with Websites, etc.)
* Career Opportunities/Experiences and Lessons Learned
* College Experiences

... and many more!

I'm Brandon Le, a student at Texas A&M University.

I enjoy learning about new technology and innovations, finance (stonks), college and education, recruiting and internships, and a bunch of other topics which may or may not be educationally related (pets, food, Texas A&M).

Alongside being CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certified, I am an active enthusiast in learning about current events relating to, finance, technology, and education. *I am by no means a definitive expert in any of these topics, but I do my best to give accurate information that helps others, and invite constructive criticism and/or correction*.

At the end of the day, my hope is that this website can teach, inspire, or entertain others about relevant life skills that I have some experience about, or that I find interesting.
