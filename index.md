**Welcome!**

### Learn about technology as it applies to real life situations.

Technology is becoming an integral part of our lives. There's thousands of guides which can help you become an expert programmer and develop tech skills. This site is for tech enthusiast, those interested in career in information technology, and those generally interested in learning a bit more about how topics such as digital security, building a PC, and other skills I've found may be useful for the future.

I'm Brandon Le, a student at Texas A&M Univeristy.

This website is a portfolio of projects and experiences I've had throughout my academic career, as well as a blog about things in life I am passionate about. At the end of the day, my hope is that this website can teach, inspire, or entertain others about the things I find interesting.

I enjoy learning and talking about about new technology and innnovations, finance (stonks), college and education, recruiting and internships, and a bunch of other, unrelated topics (pets, food, Texas A&M, Texas in general).
