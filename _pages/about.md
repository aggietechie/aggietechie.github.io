## Howdy!

I'm Brandon Le, a Management Information Systems student at Texas A&M Univeristy.

This website is a portfolio of projects and experiences I've had throughout my academic career, as well as a blog about things in life I am passionate about. At the end of the day, my hope is that this website can teach, inspire, or entertain others about the things I find interesting.

I enjoy learning and talking about about new technology and innnovations, finance (stonks), college and education, recruiting and internships, and a bunch of other, unrelated topics (pets, food, Texas A&M, Texas in general).
