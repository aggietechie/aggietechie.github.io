## What is CompTIA?

CompTIA is a great way to get started learning about a wide variety of subjects in the Information Technology sector, and get certified in said topics. They hold many of the most widely recognized industry certifications and are vendor neutral, unlike Cisco, Google, or Microsoft certifications (although this may not necessarily be indicative of quality).

You can learn more about them from their website [here](https://www.comptia.org/about-us).

I should not that I am not partnered with CompTIA - I provide no compensation and am not affiliated with them in anyway. I am simply an enthusiast and hope to share the knowledge I've gained while studying for these certifications.

**Certifications I Hold**
* CompTIA A+
* CompTIA Network+
* CompTIA Security+
